Deskacito - Smart Desk Project for BCU Innovation fest 2024
# What is this Project?
From January to May of 2024, a university-based project conducted by Team Deskacito consisting of members Haris Ahmed Dadd, Toby Skitt, Alex Anglin, Ethan Dearn and Angelo Luis Lagdameo have devised the idea of creating a **"Smart Desk"** for their project, which ultimately aimed to improve and compete with the existing products within the desk product and smart furniture market by prioritising the need to sustain the organising and security aspect of the environment where it is being currently utilised in.
